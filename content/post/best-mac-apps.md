# Best Mac Apps
Hello and welcome to my blog!

In this post, we'll review some macOS apps!


## Raycast
This could be my favorite app. It has functionality ranging from shortcuts to apps all the way to a simple Spotlight.

For example, you can use it just as a basic Spotlight, or with plugins, you can unlock endless possibilities.

For instance, I installed the Homebrew plugin for Homebrew and set the Search function to Command+Shift+K. By pressing that shortcut, typing the app name, and hitting Return twice, I can install the app. Isn't that super easy?

## iTerm
It's a terminal emulator that's better than macOS's default Terminal.

My advice is to install iTerm, open the settings with the Command+, shortcut, and tweak plenty of options. For example, you can set your theme to Minimal, it looks amazing.

## Homebrew
My favourite thing is this. It's a Linux-like package manager for macOS.

## SelfControl
You can block sites/apps with this app but don't forget, you can't unblock it even you delete app, restart your system.

## ChatGPT
This app lets you use ChatGPT in a fast and modern interface. You can even access a small ChatGPT prompt with the Option+Space shortcut. It’s incredibly good!

## Mac Mouse Fix
Mac Mouse Fix lets you use your mouse almost like a trackpad. It adds features like smooth scrolling and more.

## Alt-Tab
This brings Windows Alt+Tab menu for macOS.

## Orion Browser
My newly discovered browser. The Orion team believes Safari is the best browser, but that it needs some additions. Instead of waiting for Apple to do that, they’re doing it themselves. For example, they disable telemetry, let you choose from more than ten search engines on first launch without going into settings, include ad blockers, and its best feature—allow you to run Chrome and Firefox extensions.

## Keka
A WinRAR alternative for macOS.
