# Best Mac Apps
Hello and welcome to my blog!

In this post, we'll review some macOS apps!


## Raycast
This could be my favorite app. It has functionality ranging from shortcuts to apps all the way to a simple Spotlight.

For example, you can use it just as a basic Spotlight, or with plugins, you can unlock endless possibilities.

For instance, I installed the Homebrew plugin for Homebrew and set the Search function to Command+Shift+K. By pressing that shortcut, typing the app name, and hitting Return twice, I can install the app. Isn't that super easy?

## iTerm
It's a terminal emulator that's better than macOS's default Terminal.

My advice is to install iTerm, open the settings with the Command+, shortcut, and tweak plenty of options. For example, you can set your theme to Minimal, it looks amazing.
